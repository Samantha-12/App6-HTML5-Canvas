Brief Description of Goal of Code:
The goal of the code is to produce a canvas with a border where, depending on what button is pressed, either a rectangle, name, or image is drawn onto the canvas. The goal was also to create a button that when pressed clears the canvas of anything drawn on it.
 
Known Issues:
One known issue was trying to get my image to pop-up. I was not correctly defining the image in the function so when the draw image button was pressed nothing popped up. This was because my image was not uploaded to GitHub and therefore the function had nothing to produce. Another issue I ran into was trying to make the clear canvas button work. Everytime the button was originally clicked the canvas would not clear and all of the drawings would still be present. This was because my function and button were not properly defined and linked in the code.
